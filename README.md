# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 06, 2022
**Today's Goals**:
  - CodeWars
    - Do 5 Katas
    
**Today's Progress**: 
  - Finished my 5 katas; Check out my repository [here](https://github.com/T000bias/CodeWars/tree/main/JavaScript%20Solutions/8th%20kyu).
  
**Thoughts:**
 - Today was more about setting up for the future than completing tasks. The only major task that need to be completed was my 5 codewars per day. Over the next few days I will be going in overdrive to make it out of the catch up crew and graduate 100Devs with all assignments completed and all requirements met. 
 
### Day 2: September 12, 2022
**Today's Goals**:
  - freeCodeCamp
    - **Completed** [React for JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6gSSpfsoOQ&t=1s)
    
  - CodeWars
    - **Completed** Do 5 Katas from [here](https://www.codewars.com/collections/training-js-series-for-javascript-beginner-myjinxin2015)
  
**Today's Progress**: 
  - Started my React training from freeCodeCamp and I am completely lost, but that is part of the journey of being a software engineer. On top of learning react I also decided to learn bootstrap just to understand a CSS framework. Also did my 5 katas for today.
  
**Thoughts:**
  - Today was fine, still dealing my constant procrastination. Tomorrow, I will try a different location to see if I can get into the zone there.

  **Today's Progress:**
    - Got 2 out of the 4 chapters read from "Eloquent JavaScript".
  
  **Thoughts:**
    - I couldn't get everything on my list done, but thats no big issue. All of my task have been laid out so I always have backup work to do if I finish a day early. Nothing really major to report.
    

### Day 6: September 28, 2022

  **Today's Progress:**
  
    - Did 4 Katas based on array methods.
    - Change my approach to how I structure my learning path.
    
  **Thoughts:**
    
    - I finally figured out the method to how I want to tackle all the courses and resources I found over the past months. Instead of shifting between 20 different things, I will focus on only three items simultaneously. This week, the three main items are The Web Developer Bootcamp 2022, Eloquent JavaScript, and Shay Howe’s ‘Learn to Code HTML & CSS.’ This system will stay in place for two weeks to see how everything plays out, but I am sure this is the way it should go.
