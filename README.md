# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 06, 2022
**Today's Goals**:
  - CodeWars
    - Do 5 Katas
    
**Today's Progress**: 
  - Finished my 5 katas; Check out my repository [here](https://github.com/T000bias/CodeWars/tree/main/JavaScript%20Solutions/8th%20kyu).
  
**Thoughts:**
 - Today was more about setting up for the future than completing tasks. The only major task that need to be completed was my 5 codewars per day. Over the next few days I will be going in overdrive to make it out of the catch up crew and graduate 100Devs with all assignments completed and all requirements met.
