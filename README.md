# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 06, 2022
**Today's Goals**:
  - CodeWars
    - Do 5 Katas
    
**Today's Progress**: 
  - Finished my 5 katas; Check out my repository [here](https://github.com/T000bias/CodeWars/tree/main/JavaScript%20Solutions/8th%20kyu).
  
**Thoughts:**
 - Today was more about setting up for the future than completing tasks. The only major task that need to be completed was my 5 codewars per day. Over the next few days I will be going in overdrive to make it out of the catch up crew and graduate 100Devs with all assignments completed and all requirements met. 
 
### Day 2: September 12, 2022
**Today's Goals**:
  - freeCodeCamp
    - **Completed** [React for JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6gSSpfsoOQ&t=1s)
    
  - CodeWars
    - **Completed** Do 5 Katas from [here](https://www.codewars.com/collections/training-js-series-for-javascript-beginner-myjinxin2015)
  
**Today's Progress**: 
  - Started my React training from freeCodeCamp and I am completely lost, but that is part of the journey of being a software engineer. On top of learning react I also decided to learn bootstrap just to understand a CSS framework. Also did my 5 katas for today.
  
**Thoughts:**
  - Today was fine, still dealing my constant procrastination. Tomorrow, I will try a different location to see if I can get into the zone there.
